Interviewer: Hello, how are you?
Shopkeeper: Hello, I am fine.
Interviewer: I am doing a local survey, a survey about local businesses. I will ask you some questions, and you will answer them. Is that okay?
Shopkeeper: Yes, of course. You can ask the questions.
Interviewer: How long have you been running this shop?
Shopkeeper: Our business is quite old. Personally, I have been doing business for about 18 years, Mashallah.
Interviewer: What items do you keep in this shop?
Shopkeeper: All grocery items are available here. You can see everything in front of you. Whatever grocery items there are, I have them available.
Interviewer: Normally, how many customers come to your shop in one day? For example, 40, 50, or 100?
Shopkeeper: We have never counted exactly, but many customers come. A lot of customers come daily.
Interviewer: At what time of the day is your shop more crowded?
Shopkeeper: Mostly in the evening and at closing time, when we are about to close the shop. Otherwise, it is normal. Because of the cold weather, people don’t go out much. Apart from that, Alhamdulillah, business is fine, but in winter there are some issues.
Interviewer: When customers buy something, how do they pay you? Do they use EasyPaisa, JazzCash, or cash?
Shopkeeper: All methods work here. Customers pay in cash, through EasyPaisa, JazzCash, bank transfer, and we also use SadaPay and NayaPay.
Interviewer: So all these services like JazzCash and EasyPaisa are available with you?
Shopkeeper: Yes.
Interviewer: When did you start accepting online payments, and why did you start?
Shopkeeper: We started because many customers were coming and asking to pay online. Most customers wanted to pay online because they did not have cash. It became very common. Everyone was saying they wanted to pay online, so we had to keep this option. Otherwise, our business was being affected.
Interviewer: Before accepting online payments, what kind of fear did you have in your mind?
Shopkeeper: Mostly, there was fear because in direct or instant payments, problems often happen. A message comes, but the payment does not arrive. Honestly, my heart is broken because of this. Two or three times, fraud has happened to me. The money did not come through direct payments.
Shopkeeper: That is why I also tell elders that whenever there is any payment, it should be taken only through EasyPaisa. Do not take other types of payments, because many times the money does not come. The message comes, but the money does not arrive.
Interviewer: Has any customer ever come to you and said they want to send money to someone, gave you cash, and asked you to transfer it to another account?
Shopkeeper: Yes, of course. That is basically EasyPaisa work. If we already have cash or balance in the account, and someone comes, we transfer the money. There is no issue with that.
Interviewer: The last time a customer came, what did they ask you to transfer?
Shopkeeper: The last time, it was 1,500 rupees. I was not here at that time; I had gone somewhere. My father was here. He messaged me and said, “Son, a message has come that 1,500 rupees were received.” When I checked later, I realized it was fraud. The money never came.
Interviewer: That is very bad.
Interviewer: Has any customer ever come to you with dollars and asked you to exchange them?
Shopkeeper: No, that has never happened. No customer has ever come with dollars. Usually, customers deal in Pakistani rupees or online payments.
Interviewer: Do you know any places where people can exchange dollars or other foreign currency?
Shopkeeper: I think there are no such places here. In Islamabad sectors, there are exchange offices. I have personally used one before. They are proper permanent exchange shops. Otherwise, no one else does this work.
Interviewer: In the past few years, have you seen any customer or shopkeeper who suffered a loss or fraud related to money?
Shopkeeper: I have not seen others, but it has already happened to me, as I told you earlier. Because of this, we avoid such payments now. Whenever a customer comes, I tell them to first call and confirm whether the payment has actually arrived before leaving, because fraud has happened with me many times.
Interviewer: When you first started this shop, what items did you keep? And what new services have you added over time?
Shopkeeper: This business is very old and runs in our family. It started before I was even born. In our sector and nearby areas, you will find many shops from our family. This is our family profession. When elders leave, others take their place.
Interviewer: Do you plan to expand your business in the future?
Shopkeeper: We try, but looking at the current situation, business is very difficult. We are just trying to survive and continue the shop.
Interviewer: Thank you very much for your time.
Shopkeeper: Thank you. Allah Hafiz.
