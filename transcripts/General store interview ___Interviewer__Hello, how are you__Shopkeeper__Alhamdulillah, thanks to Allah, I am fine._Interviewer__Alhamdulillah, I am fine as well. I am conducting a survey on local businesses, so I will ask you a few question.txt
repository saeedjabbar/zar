General store interview 


Interviewer:
Hello, how are you?
Shopkeeper:
Alhamdulillah, thanks to Allah, I am fine.
Interviewer:
Alhamdulillah, I am fine as well. I am conducting a survey on local businesses, so I will ask you a few questions. You need to answer them, okay?
Shopkeeper:
Okay.
Interviewer:
How is your business going these days?
Shopkeeper:
These days, business is not good at all. For about a year now, things have changed. Earlier, business was going very well, Alhamdulillah. But for the past few months, it has completely gone down. Last month was also not good. For about three to four months, business has been very slow. It is not like before.
Interviewer:
Apart from the shop, do you provide any other services, like JazzCash, EasyPaisa, bill payments, or mobile top-ups?
Shopkeeper:
No, no. We only do grocery business. We don’t do mobile load or these other services.
Interviewer:
If a customer does not have cash and wants to make a payment transfer, do you accept JazzCash or EasyPaisa?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, we accept EasyPaisa. If someone says they don’t have cash, we say okay, you can pay through EasyPaisa.
Interviewer:
In the past one or two years, have you added any new services to your shop apart from grocery items?
Shopkeeper:
No, nothing new. We are just doing the same work as before.
Interviewer:
How many customers come to your shop in one day?
Shopkeeper:
We have never really estimated the number of customers. Business is just running somehow. Alhamdulillah. But it is not like before. It is down compared to earlier.
Interviewer:
Does any of your family members live abroad or run a business outside the country?
Shopkeeper:
No, no one lives abroad. Everyone is here.
Interviewer:
Do you know anyone who exchanges currency, for example dollars or other foreign currencies?
Shopkeeper:
No, I don’t know about this.
Interviewer:
So you don’t have much awareness about currency exchange?
Shopkeeper:
No, not at all. We just focus on our business. We don’t know about these things.
Interviewer:
Apart from this work, has anyone ever offered you a new service or business opportunity? For example, someone asking you to work with them, invest money, or start another business?
Shopkeeper:
I am not very involved in such things. My elder brother usually handles these matters, so he might know. No one has asked me personally to invest or get involved in another business.
Interviewer:
If a new service or opportunity comes, like online work or something similar, how do you decide whether to invest in it?
Shopkeeper:
If we don’t have knowledge about something, we don’t invest in it. First, we get proper information. Only after understanding it do people invest. If we don’t know about something, we don’t invest much in it.
Interviewer:
If someone tells you about an online business and asks you to invest, would you do it?
Shopkeeper:
No. If I don’t have information about it, I won’t invest. I don’t trust things without proper knowledge.
Interviewer:
If there were a way to earn extra income, how would you manage it along with this shop? Would you do it or not?
Shopkeeper:
We already have experience in this work, and we understand it well. So we will continue with this work. In the future, InshaAllah, we want to grow this same business. We are not interested in other things because we have experience only in this work.
Interviewer:
So your family members and brothers are also involved in the same business?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, from the beginning, we have all been doing the same business.
Interviewer:
This is your own shop, right?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, Alhamdulillah, it is our own shop.
Interviewer:
Alright, thank you very much for your time. You gave us so much time.
Shopkeeper:
Okay, Allah Hafiz.
