Interviewer:
Peace be upon you. How are you?

Shopkeeper:
Peace be upon you too. Yes, Alhamdulillah. How are you?

Interviewer:
Alhamdulillah, I am fine too. Okay, I am doing a survey about a local business. I will ask you some questions, and I will also record them. You will answer them, right?

Shopkeeper:
Yes, most welcome.

Interviewer:
How long have you been running this shop?

Shopkeeper:
For about eighteen to twenty years, Mashallah.

Interviewer:
Mashallah. How many customers come to your shop in one day?

Shopkeeper:
There is no fixed limit for customers. The shop is open seven days a week. Out of those seven days, about two to three days are good, and the remaining days just pass normally.

Interviewer:
At what time of the day do more customers come? Like in the morning, afternoon, or evening?

Shopkeeper:
Mostly in the evening, after Maghrib. Also, some customers come in the morning, around twelve to two in the afternoon.

Interviewer:
How do customers make payments to you?

Shopkeeper:
Customers pay both online and in cash.

Interviewer:
Which online payment methods do you accept?

Shopkeeper:
We accept Easypaisa, bank transfer, JazzCash, SadaPay — basically all online payment methods.

Interviewer:
Why did you decide to start taking online payments from customers?

Shopkeeper:
These days, because the situation is not good, most people prefer online payments. People mostly keep money in banks and use online transfers. They like to use credit cards, debit cards, or mobile apps. Because of the current situation, people do not carry cash much, so they prefer to pay online. Mostly, people pay online for shopping.

Interviewer:
Before accepting online payments, did you have any security concerns or fear?

Shopkeeper:
Yes, many times fraud happens. Sometimes payments do not actually arrive in the account, and bank messages come late. It happened once with us as well. A payment of around 8,500 rupees came through JazzCash. We received the message, but after some time, the money disappeared from the account.

Interviewer:
So that was a fraud case?

Shopkeeper:
Yes, it was a fraud case. He transferred money from JazzCash to Easypaisa. I went to the Easypaisa office and showed them the message. I told them that the message came but the payment did not arrive. They said that payments do not come like this and that JazzCash reversed it. There is some time limit — maybe half an hour or some time — after which JazzCash reversed the payment.

Interviewer:
Do you also do dollar exchange?

Shopkeeper:
No, we do not do dollar exchange.

Interviewer:
If a customer comes to you and asks for dollar exchange, what do you tell them?

Shopkeeper:
We tell them that there is a money changer near our shop. We ask them to go there and get the money exchanged. Sometimes we even send a boy with them to help. There is no issue; we help them.

Interviewer:
Have you ever heard about fraud cases happening to nearby shopkeepers or other businesses?

Shopkeeper:
No, I have not heard about it.

Interviewer:
So you have not heard about fraud happening around you, but it did happen to you once?

Shopkeeper:
Yes. Fraud keeps happening. This is Pakistan; it is almost impossible that fraud does not happen here. People lie and deceive. What else can we say? May Allah make things better. May Allah protect everyone. Ameen.

Interviewer:
When you first started this shop, what items did you keep? And what did you add later?

Shopkeeper:
In the beginning, we started with gents’ items. Slowly, we added ladies’ items and then children’s items. As time passed, Allah kept giving us opportunities, and we kept adding more things. The shop is running well, Alhamdulillah. Allah is managing everything.

Interviewer:
Do you plan to expand this business further?

Shopkeeper:
InshaAllah, if Allah gives us the opportunity, we will definitely expand it.

Interviewer:
Thank you very much for your time.

Shopkeeper:
No, no, you are most welcome. Thank you very much. Allah Hafiz.

Interviewer:
Allah Hafiz.
