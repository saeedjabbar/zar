Pharmacist interview 


Interviewer:
Hello, how are you?
Pharmacist:
Hello, I’m fine. How are you?
Interviewer:
Alhamdulillah, I am fine too. Actually, I am conducting a local survey on local businesses. I would like to ask you a few questions. If you agree to answer them, may I ask you the questions? I will also record these questions. Do I have your permission?
Pharmacist:
Yes, yes, you may record them.
Interviewer:
Alright, thank you very much.
How long has it been since you started running this pharmacy?
Pharmacist:
Alhamdulillah, our pharmacy has been running for about seven years.
Interviewer:
Approximately how many customers come in one day? I mean, how many patients visit your pharmacy on a daily basis?
Pharmacist:
Many patients come because the pharmacy is located right in front of the hospital, so there is a lot of rush. Around two hundred patients visit daily.
Interviewer:
Okay. During which part of the day is the pharmacy most crowded?
Pharmacist:
After around twelve noon, there is a lot of rush. From the start of the day, there is also heavy crowding because the hospital opens at nine o’clock. Patients first go to the hospital, and after that, they come to our pharmacy with prescriptions written by doctors and buy medicines from here.
Interviewer:
Alright. How do patients make payments at your pharmacy? Do they pay in cash, or are there other payment methods?
Pharmacist:
Patients mostly pay in cash. We also have other payment methods such as JazzCash, EasyPaisa, and bank payments. We also have a credit card system, SadaPay, and NayaPay. We accept whichever payment method is easiest for the patient.
Interviewer:
When did you start mobile or online payment methods?
Pharmacist:
We started mobile payments about four years ago. Before that, we mostly accepted cash. Later, we also started an online payment system, and now we take online payments from patients as well.
Interviewer:
Before starting online payments, what concerns did you have? What kind of worries did you face at the beginning?
Pharmacist:
When we first started online payments, we were worried about fraud. Sometimes payments get stuck. Some patients do not have biometric verification completed for JazzCash, so payments take a long time. We were afraid that the payment might get stuck or not come at all.
Interviewer:
Do you still face problems with online payments now?
Pharmacist:
No, not very often. But sometimes issues occur through bank mobile apps like UBL or other bank apps. EMI or payment transfer issues can happen occasionally.
Interviewer:
Has any customer ever asked for your help in sending or receiving money? For example, if a customer did not have cash and asked you to give cash in exchange for online transfer?
Pharmacist:
No, we do not do such work. We only accept online payments from patients who buy medicines from us. We do not transfer money for anyone.
Interviewer:
Has any customer ever come to you with dollars or foreign currency and asked you to exchange it?
Pharmacist:
No, as I told you earlier, we do not do that kind of work.
Interviewer:
If someone asks you to exchange dollars, where do you send them?
Pharmacist:
We do not exchange dollars ourselves because that is not our work. Our job is to manage the pharmacy, provide medicines to patients, and manage stock. We guide such patients to Western Union or banks, where they can exchange their dollars.
Interviewer:
In recent years, have you ever heard of any shopkeeper, pharmacy, or hospital involved in money fraud?
Pharmacist:
No, no. I have never heard of such incidents. I am not very involved in these matters, but I have never heard of any patient, pharmacist, or nurse facing financial fraud or loss.
Interviewer:
How did you start your pharmacy initially?
Pharmacist:
In the beginning, we only started with medicines. Gradually, we added more items. As you can see, we added glucose boxes, chips, and items like marshmallows. Many patients come with children, and children ask for these items. So we added them. Earlier, we only had medicines, but over time we added more items. We also added items that may be needed, such as a wheelchair and similar products.
Interviewer:
Who advised you to add these extra items?
Pharmacist:
This is a marketing strategy. It is quite beneficial. We saw a few other pharmacies offering such items, so we also started keeping them.
Interviewer:
Do you plan to expand your pharmacy further in the future?
Pharmacist:
Yes, InshaAllah. Alhamdulillah, the profit is good, so we will continue expanding the pharmacy. Our mission is to move toward success.
Interviewer:
Thank you very much for your time.
Allah Hafiz.
Pharmacist:
