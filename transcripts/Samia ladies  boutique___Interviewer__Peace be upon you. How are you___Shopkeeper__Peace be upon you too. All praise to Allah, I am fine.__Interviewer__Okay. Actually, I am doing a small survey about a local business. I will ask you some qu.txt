Samia ladies  boutique


Interviewer:
Peace be upon you. How are you?

Shopkeeper:
Peace be upon you too. All praise to Allah, I am fine.

Interviewer:
Okay. Actually, I am doing a small survey about a local business. I will ask you some questions, and I will also record them. Do I have your permission to do this?

Shopkeeper:
Yes, yes, that is fine. You can do it.

Interviewer:
So, how long have you been running your boutique?

Shopkeeper:
Alhamdulillah, it has been ten years.

Interviewer:
Mashallah. So approximately how many customers come these days? Around one hundred, fifty, or how many?

Shopkeeper:
Customers do come, and it keeps varying. On a daily basis, around fifty to sixty customers come.

Interviewer:
On which days or which time of the day is there more rush?

Shopkeeper:
Mostly, there is more rush during the daytime. Students come more — college-going and university-going girls and boys mostly visit.

Interviewer:
How do customers usually make payments? Do they pay in cash, or do you have other payment methods as well?

Shopkeeper:
No, we also have card payment available. Payments can be made through cards, but mostly customers pay in cash.

Interviewer:
Which mobile apps do you use for receiving payments?

Shopkeeper:
Basically, we have Easypaisa and JazzCash, and we also have SadaPay. Since many customers are students, these methods are easy for them.

Interviewer:
How long has it been since you started taking mobile or online payments?

Shopkeeper:
It has been about two to three years since I started taking mobile payments.

Interviewer:
Before taking online payments, what were you afraid of?

Shopkeeper:
In the beginning, I was afraid of scams. But now it is not like that. When they show screenshots and I receive confirmation messages, I am sure that the payment has been received.

Interviewer:
Why did you decide to start taking online payments?

Shopkeeper:
Because it is easily available. Not everyone carries cash all the time. People have money in their accounts. So, for the convenience of our customers, we introduced different payment methods so they can pay easily.

Interviewer:
That is a very good thing. Has any customer ever come to you, given you cash, and asked you to transfer that money online to someone else?

Shopkeeper:
No. Look, this is a boutique setup, so we do not do this kind of work. We only take payments — either cash or through mobile apps like Easypaisa. We do not transfer money to others. We keep payments only for ourselves because this is not our policy.

Interviewer:
Has any customer ever asked you about dollars or foreign currency?

Shopkeeper:
No, nothing like that.

Interviewer:
If a customer comes and says they have dollars and wants to exchange them, would you do it?

Shopkeeper:
No. As I told you, this is a boutique setup. We do not exchange dollars. We only take payments in our own local currency.

Interviewer:
Do you know any shops or services that transfer or exchange money, where you guide customers if they ask for help?

Shopkeeper:
Yes, we know about such services in the market. We guide customers and tell them to go to specific shops, for example after 7 PM, where they can transfer or exchange money and get help.

Interviewer:
Which services do you know for dollar exchange, like banks or other places?

Shopkeeper:
There are Western Union services. People usually go there to exchange money.

Interviewer:
In the past year, have you seen or heard about any fraud related to money, where someone suffered a loss?

Shopkeeper:
This is part of life; small frauds do happen sometimes. We do see such things, but Alhamdulillah, nothing like that has happened with us.

Interviewer:
So you have not personally experienced anything serious?

Shopkeeper:
No, not really. It happens sometimes, but we have not experienced it directly.

Interviewer:
How did you start your boutique? What items did you have in the beginning, and what new services or products did you add later?

Shopkeeper:
When we started, we began with a female collection only. But with the passage of time, as demand increased, we added many varieties for children as well. Along with that, we also added a men’s collection. Now we have different varieties, as you can see.

Interviewer:
Did you take advice before adding these new items? Why did you decide to add them?

Shopkeeper:
Yes. Since this is a boutique, it is not possible that only females will come. We wanted to provide services to everyone. That is why we added different varieties — for children, females, adults, and men.

Interviewer:
Do you earn good profit?

Shopkeeper:
Yes, Alhamdulillah.

Interviewer:
Are you planning to expand your boutique further?

Shopkeeper:
Yes, I will expand it. With time, by the will of Allah, I am planning a much bigger setup. Work on it is already in progress, InshaAllah.

Interviewer:
InshaAllah. May Allah give you success. Thank you very much for your time.

Shopkeeper:
Okay, Allah Hafiz. Thank you very much for giving us so much time.

Interviewer:
No problem. Allah Hafiz.

Shopkeeper:
Allah Hafiz.
