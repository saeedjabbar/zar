Interviewer: Assalamu Alaikum, how are you?
Shopkeeper: Wa Alaikum Assalam, Alhamdulillah, I am perfectly fine. How about you?
Interviewer: Alhamdulillah, I am also fine. Okay, how long have you been working at this pharmacy?
Shopkeeper: Okay, this pharmacy… I have been working here for approximately four years, four to five years.
Interviewer: Okay, normally how many patients come here in a day?
Shopkeeper: Well, the rush is usually quite high and it’s hard to manage. Normally about two hundred to two hundred fifty patients come.
Interviewer: Okay, at what time is the rush more?
Shopkeeper: The rush is mostly in the evening. At that time, more people come.
Interviewer: How do customers pay you in the evening?
Shopkeeper: Customers pay us however they like, in whichever way is comfortable for them. We accept all methods, we take everything.
Interviewer: So you take cash as well?
Shopkeeper: Yes, we take cash, and we also take from accounts—any easy payment account or anything like that. So cash is included. Payments via mobile are possible through any method.
Interviewer: Which mobile payments do you accept?
Shopkeeper: JazzCash, DPay, NayaPay, bank transfers, EasyPaisa, every method.
Interviewer: Okay, which bank transfers do you accept?
Shopkeeper: Any bank—Allied Bank, UBL, any bank—we accept all.
Interviewer: How long ago did you start taking online payments from your customers?
Shopkeeper: About one and a half years, we have been taking online payments.
Interviewer: And how long have you been working here in the pharmacy?
Shopkeeper: Working here in the pharmacy for four to five years, Alhamdulillah.
Interviewer: That’s very good. When you first started taking online payments, what were you worried about?
Shopkeeper: At first, there were many schemes in society, so I had no idea about them. I had never taken online payments before, and there were no guidelines. I was worried about many things, but I ignored them and continued my work. Now, after one and a half years, it’s going very well. Experience has helped a lot.
Interviewer: Why did you decide to start taking online payments from customers?
Shopkeeper: Good question. Many patients came here without cash, which was very difficult for them and for us. So we thought it would be easier for them if we offered different payment methods, and that’s why we started. Since then, we have been quite relaxed about it.
Interviewer: Have any customers ever come to you with foreign currency and asked you to exchange it?
Shopkeeper: No, no, absolutely not. We do not do that. We don’t have such facilities. If someone gives foreign currency, we don’t exchange it.
Interviewer: Okay. Are there shops nearby in Islamabad that provide such services?
Shopkeeper: Yes, there are many shops nearby, like in the market. We guide patients so it’s easier for them, and it’s also easier for us. For example, near the market or Western Union, many shops do this, and we prefer them.
Interviewer: Have you ever seen a shopkeeper around you lose money or get scammed?
Shopkeeper: No, I haven’t seen such a thing. I don’t pay much attention to that in society.
Interviewer: How did you start your pharmacy, and what did you add over time?
Shopkeeper: Initially, we started small with only medicines, which were limited. Over time, we added more products, and now, Alhamdulillah, it’s going very well.
Interviewer: Do you plan to expand your setup further?
Shopkeeper: Yes, of course. Any business never ends. InshaAllah, we will continue to expand. You can see the setup will be even better in the future.
Interviewer: Thank you very much for your time.
Shopkeeper: Thank you so much, nice to meet you. Thank you.
