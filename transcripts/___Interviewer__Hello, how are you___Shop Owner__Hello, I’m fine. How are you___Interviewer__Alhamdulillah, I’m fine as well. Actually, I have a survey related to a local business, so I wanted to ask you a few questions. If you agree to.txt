Interviewer:
Hello, how are you?

Shop Owner:
Hello, I’m fine. How are you?

Interviewer:
Alhamdulillah, I’m fine as well. Actually, I have a survey related to a local business, so I wanted to ask you a few questions. If you agree to answer them, may I ask?

Shop Owner:
Yes, yes, you can ask.

Interviewer:
With your permission, I would also like to record your answers. Is that okay?

Shop Owner:
Yes, no issue.

Interviewer:
Alright. So, how long have you been running this boutique?

Shop Owner:
MashaAllah, I have been running this boutique for ten years, and our business is going very well. We also provide online services. We have reels on Instagram, many customers contact us online, and we provide them online services. Our delivery is very fast.

Interviewer:
How many customers visit your shop in one day?

Shop Owner:
In one day, more than twenty customers come. There is a lot of rush during the day. At night, it becomes a little less. Morning time is also very busy. Our services are fast, so Alhamdulillah, business runs well and we get very good reviews.

Interviewer:
What kind of items do you sell?

Shop Owner:
We sell clothes in different varieties, such as cotton and other types of fabrics. We have children’s clothes, adults’ clothes, and some jeans for small children as well.

Interviewer:
MashaAllah. How do customers pay you? Do they pay in cash or do you also have an online transfer system?

Shop Owner:
We have an online transfer system as well, but mostly customers pay in cash. However, when we deliver online orders, we prefer receiving payment through account transfer.

Interviewer:
Which online payment apps are available? For example, if I come to your shop and want to pay online, which apps can I use?

Shop Owner:
We have Easypaisa, JazzCash, SadaPay, and different bank accounts like Allied Bank and Islamic Bank. We have bank software available, so customers can transfer money easily.

Interviewer:
Why did you start accepting online payments? Initially, you must have been taking only cash. Why did you start online payments?

Shop Owner:
Many people place orders from outside the city or from abroad for their families and children. It is difficult for them to pay in cash. That’s why we started this system, so it would be easier for them and our business could continue smoothly, and they could receive their items easily.

Interviewer:
For example, if I come to your shop and I don’t have cash and ask you to give me money, would you do that?

Shop Owner:
No, we don’t do that. Of course, we cannot. But if someone buys something and genuinely doesn’t have cash, we may accept online payment. Still, we prefer cash.

Interviewer:
When you started online transfers, were you afraid of anything? Did you see others using online transfers and then decide to start?

Shop Owner:
When my boutique started becoming popular, more customers began coming. Reviews increased, and people started following trends and placing online orders. Obviously, online orders require online payments, so thinking about this, I started the system.

Interviewer:
Has it ever happened that a customer asked you to send money to someone on their behalf and gave you cash to do so?

Shop Owner:
No, that doesn’t happen. I am running a business; I cannot send money for others or give cash to people like that.

Interviewer:
If someone comes to you with foreign currency or asks you to exchange money, do you provide that service?

Shop Owner:
No, we do not exchange money. We guide them to Western Union or banks for that service.

Interviewer:
Do you know where money exchange can be done?

Shop Owner:
Yes, Western Union and some banks.

Interviewer:
If someone wants to exchange dollars, where do you send them?

Shop Owner:
Mostly to Western Union.

Interviewer:
Why don’t you do money exchange yourself?

Shop Owner:
Because my business is a clothing boutique. I cannot do that business. I want to focus on my boutique and grow it further.

Interviewer:
You are thinking of expanding your business.

Shop Owner:
Yes, I want my business to grow more and more. I advertise internationally so people from other countries can buy from me, get good reviews, and my boutique can grow properly.

Interviewer:
That’s very good. Have you ever seen fraud happening in nearby boutiques related to money?

Shop Owner:
No, I have never seen anything like that.

Interviewer:
How did you start your boutique initially? What items did you sell at the beginning?

Shop Owner:
I started with a small collection of ladies’ clothes, then children’s items like jeans, jackets, winter clothes, and hems for children. Gradually, I added different fabrics—thick, thin, and different styles. It took about a year of hard work. It was difficult in the beginning, but later it improved, and when I saw profit, I expanded further.

Interviewer:
Will you continue this business in the future?

Shop Owner:
Yes, InshaAllah. I want my brand to spread all over the world.

Interviewer:
MashaAllah, you seem very motivated. Thank you so much for your time. May Allah grant you success.

Shop Owner:
Ameen. Allah Hafiz. Take care.
