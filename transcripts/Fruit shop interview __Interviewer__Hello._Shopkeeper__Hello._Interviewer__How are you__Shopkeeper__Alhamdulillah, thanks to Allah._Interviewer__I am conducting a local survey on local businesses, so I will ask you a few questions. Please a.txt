Fruit shop interview 

Interviewer:
Hello.
Shopkeeper:
Hello.
Interviewer:
How are you?
Shopkeeper:
Alhamdulillah, thanks to Allah.
Interviewer:
I am conducting a local survey on local businesses, so I will ask you a few questions. Please answer them, okay? I will also record this. Is that okay?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, that is fine.
Interviewer:
How long have you been running this shop?
Shopkeeper:
It has been about ten to twelve years.
Interviewer:
How many customers come to your shop in one day? Around how many customers visit daily?
Shopkeeper:
Not many. Sometimes ten, sometimes twenty, sometimes fifty, sometimes a hundred, but usually around twenty to twenty-five customers. Business is very slow.
Interviewer:
At what time of the day is your shop most crowded?
Shopkeeper:
There is no rush at any time. It stays quiet. People either come out of their homes or go to the vegetable market. Since the vegetable market is nearby, business does not run well here. This is a vegetable business.
Interviewer:
What items do you sell in your shop?
Shopkeeper:
We sell vegetables and fruits. Only these two things. Nothing else.
Interviewer:
So you don’t have any other work besides this?
Shopkeeper:
No. We have been working here from the start. We are not educated or literate, so this is our problem.
Interviewer:
How do customers pay you? Do they pay in cash, JazzCash, or EasyPaisa?
Shopkeeper:
We don’t understand EasyPaisa or such things. Customers pay small cash amounts like ten rupees for coriander, twenty for chilies, forty for tomatoes. This is very small-scale work. I already told you that business does not run well here.
Interviewer:
So you don’t accept JazzCash or EasyPaisa?
Shopkeeper:
No, we don’t, because we don’t have any system for it and we are not educated.
Interviewer:
Have you ever thought that if you got a chance, you would start accepting online payments like EasyPaisa, JazzCash, or bank transfer?
Shopkeeper:
We are not educated, so how would we take online payments? I don’t know anything about it.
Interviewer:
Do you also fear fraud if you start online payments?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, there is fear. People who are educated know how EasyPaisa works, how names appear, how numbers come. We are not educated, so we are afraid.
Interviewer:
Has any customer ever asked you for help, like asking you to transfer money to someone’s account?
Shopkeeper:
No, not here. Sometimes people tell us that there is an EasyPaisa shop nearby, so we send them there. There is an EasyPaisa shop near the post office.
Interviewer:
So you guide people to that shop?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, they go there and withdraw or send money from there.
Interviewer:
If someone had dollars or foreign currency and asked you to exchange it, would you know what to do?
Shopkeeper:
No, that has never happened. No one has ever come like that.
Interviewer:
Do you know any place where foreign currency can be exchanged?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, in Saddar or Raja Bazaar. Currency is exchanged there.
Interviewer:
Have you ever heard of any shopkeeper who was cheated or faced financial fraud?
Shopkeeper:
No, I have never heard of any fraud. Nothing like that has happened to anyone, as far as I know.
Interviewer:
Have you ever thought about expanding your business, like adding grocery items such as soap, shampoo, flour, lentils, or rice?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, we have thought about it, but we don’t have financial resources. We don’t have enough money to buy more items.
Interviewer:
If your financial condition improves, would you expand your business?
Shopkeeper:
Yes, then we would expand it, double it, and add more items.
Interviewer:
Are you satisfied with your current business?
Shopkeeper:
Not really, because expenses are not fully covered, and there are many problems. But we thank Allah. Allah is the one who provides.
Interviewer:
May Allah help you and grant you success. Thank you very much for your time.
Shopkeeper:
Thank you very much. Allah Hafiz.
